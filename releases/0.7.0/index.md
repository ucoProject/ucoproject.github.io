#### Release Notes

UCO 0.7.0 is primarily focused on the conversion of UCO ontologies to leverage the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) rather than domain assertions and owl property restrictions to define class shapes. In addition, it added a Continuous Integration (CI) method for testing and verifying the ontology and it corrects several minor issues and bugs.
